Two simple scripts were created for financial analysis for two different fictional companies.  Pybank analyzes a budget.csv file and returns metrics such as net total profit, average changes in profit, greatest increase in profit, and greatest increase in losses.  PyRamen analyzes a restuarants's per product profitiability to better understand which products may need to be removed or changed. Both results are ouputted to text files.
